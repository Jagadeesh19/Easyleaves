# EasyLeaves

Easy-leaves is a web application intended to solve the leave problems of the employees in an Organization. The application assumes that the level of authority in organizations follows a tree structure. That means an employee (internal node of tree) in an organization involves two roles, one of a supervisor and another of a supervisee. Some employees can only act as supervisee (leaf nodes of a tree). Through this application the employee can apply leave to his respective supervisor (parent node of the employee node). The employee can also check and approve the leaves of his supervisees (child nodes of the employee). 
This application provides a login feature or authentication for each employee of an organization.
There is an admin (other than employee) who can access the application. The admin is responsible for adding and removing employees from an organization (adding and removing nodes from a tree).
